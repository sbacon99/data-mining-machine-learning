The network appears to consist of a few \"highly connected\" people, but the overwhelming majority of people do not have many connections. The visualization also suggests that this network is rather sparse, because the number of edges is very small compared to the amount of possible edges. A dense network would have significantly more edges. Lastly, there appear to be a few individuals who know people from all different areas of the community because they are located more centrally in the web.

Degree is simply a measure of how many edges branch out from a specific node. In the context of this network, it indicates how many people a specific person knew. Betweenness centrality, on the other hand, is a numerical indication of how many degrees of separate someone from every other person in the network.
